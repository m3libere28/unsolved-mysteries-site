    title: "EMF Meter",
    history: "The EMF meter, first used in paranormal investigations in the 1970s, revolutionized ghost hunting by detecting electromagnetic field fluctuations. These devices were originally designed for electricians but found a new purpose when investigators discovered that unexplained EMF spikes often coincided with reported paranormal activity.",
    features: [
      "Real-time EMF readings",
      "Color-coded intensity levels",
      "Historical data logging",
      "Anomaly detection",
      "Multi-axis field measurement",
      "Temperature correlation"
    ]

    title: "Thermal Sensor",
    history: "Thermal imaging in ghost hunting emerged from military and scientific applications. These devices detect cold spots and temperature anomalies, which paranormal investigators believe may indicate spiritual presence. Modern thermal sensors can create detailed heat maps and track temperature changes over time.",
    features: [
      "Infrared temperature sensing",
      "Cold spot detection",

    title: "Spirit Recorder",
    history: "Electronic Voice Phenomena (EVP) recording began in the 1950s when Friedrich JÃ¼rgenson discovered unexplained voices in his nature recordings. This led to dedicated EVP research and the development of specialized recording equipment designed to capture sounds beyond normal human hearing.",
    features: [
      "High-sensitivity microphone",
      "White noise filtering",
      "Frequency analysis",
      "Voice isolation",

  spiritBox: {
    title: "Spirit Box",
    history: "The Spirit Box, developed in the early 2000s, rapidly scans radio frequencies to create white noise. Paranormal investigators theorize that spirits can manipulate this energy to form words and communicate. Modern versions include advanced filtering and pattern recognition.",
    features: [
      "Rapid frequency scanning",
